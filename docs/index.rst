Phormium documentation
======================

Phormium is a minimalist ORM for PHP.

It's tested on informix, mysql, postgresql and sqlite.

Could work with other relational databases which have a PDO driver, or may
require some changes.

.. caution:: This is a work in progress. Things may change. Do not use for
   anything serious, yet.

Why?
----

Why another ORM, I hear you cry! Well, first and foremost, no other ORM I found
works with Informix, and I'm tied to Informix on my day job. It's a real pain
writing CRUD functions by hand. Second, It's fun to try and write an ORM. Tell
me how you like it.

Phormium documentation
======================

Phormium is a minimalist ORM for PHP.

It's tested on informix, mysql, postgresql and sqlite.

Could work with other relational databases which have a PDO driver, or may
require some changes.

.. caution:: This is a work in progress. Test before using! Report any bugs
   on `Github <https://github.com/ihabunek/phormium/issues>`_.
